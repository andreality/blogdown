				<p>I’m starting to feel like one of those forlorn sailors from old-timey days, shipwrecked in some god-forsaken land without food, beginning to seriously contemplate cannibalism as their compatriots&rsquo; limbs start to more closely resemble juicy chicken drumsticks than fleshy appendages.</p>

<p>Day 10: Still hurts. More elliptical. I wonder how difficult it would be to smash this thing? Where are those old golf clubs we have… But I jest - I truly don’t mind the elliptical. The one and only leg up that indoor/stationary training has on outdoor activities is the ability to watch TV. I’ve blown through House of Cards and am well into the third season of The Americans now. This injury has lifted my TV-watching game to another level. Too bad there is zero practical value to this achievement. Maybe I should start watching some documentaries.</p>

<p>Speaking of documentaries - we watched Blackfish on the weekend. Sad sad sad, for both the whales and the humans involved. I’d never given it much thought before, but it seems crazy that trainers would swim around in a tank with multiple orcas. The possibility of an accident, let alone an act of aggression by a cooped-up, stressed-out whale, seems like an unreasonable risk. I feel about this the same way I feel about free solo rock climbing - no matter how mind-blowingly skilled you are (e.g. Alex Honnold) there always has to be something you can’t control for, some element of chance that no amount of skill or preparation can account for. A piece of rock that becomes unhinged at precisely the wrong time, or in this case a whale executing a maneuver a few seconds early. I’m on the living-in-a-bubble side of risk aversion, so these kinds of risks seem crazy to me.</p>

<p>Back to injury-land. As usual when I get injured so close to a race, there’s a volatile cocktail of anger, self-pity, frustration and regret brewing just below the surface. Every one of those emotions is totally overblown and irrational of course, so it’s a mind game of whack-a-mole trying to suppress them as they arise with more reasonable, less crazed thoughts. Who am I angry at, myself? Maybe. The running gods? Silliness. Self-pity is laughable - I have an injury that prevents me from doing exactly one thing that I like to do, woe is me. Overlooking the countless people with actually real health problems, there’s a runner in my company who was one good race away from making the Olympic standard (which essentially meant he would automatically go), and he recently found out he has a stress fracture in his foot. Worst case I don’t run Boston this year, and I have to wait exactly one year for the opportunity to repeat itself. I’m not missing the Olympics so let’s keep things in perspective.</p>

<p>Moving on to frustration and regret, the two most persistent little mole-heads. Frustration because I’m doing everything I can to get better. I’m a good little convalescent, not even tempted to run again until it’s pain-free, doing whatever mobility and strengthening exercises I can, yet still it improves at a snails pace. And regret because there were warning signs, however small and easily-dismissed at the time. Two runs with tight and achey lower legs that I assumed were run-of-the-mill training soreness. And a long run that felt good but was probably what did the most damage. Maybe if I had taken a break at the first sign of soreness I could have avoided the hot mess my lower leg is in right now… or maybe the damage was already done at that point. We’ll never know. Frustration at the rate of improvement and regret at missing a potential chance to nip it in the bud are both futile feelings. I cannot change the past and I cannot magically accelerate the healing process. As this amazing decorative duct-tape I have reminds me - DILL WITH IT!</p>
