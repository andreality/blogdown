      <description>I’m starting to feel like one of those forlorn sailors from old-timey days, shipwrecked in some god-forsaken land without food, beginning to seriously contemplate cannibalism as their compatriots&amp;rsquo; limbs start to more closely resemble juicy chicken drumsticks than fleshy appendages.
Day 10: Still hurts. More elliptical. I wonder how difficult it would be to smash this thing? Where are those old golf clubs we have… But I jest - I truly don’t mind the elliptical.</description>

      <description>&#34;How did it get so late so soon? It&#39;s night before it&#39;s afternoon. December is here before it&#39;s June. My goodness how the time has flewn. How did it get so late so soon?&#34; - Dr.Seuss  I love having short hair - it requires a mere 90 seconds of attention each morning and has reduced my shampoo consumption at least ten-fold. The only drawback is it requires more frequent haircuts - every 4-5 weeks if I’m to avoid that perpetually disheveled, unkempt look.</description>

Poor blog, this must be how you feel after an entire summer of neglect. The writing and computer-y projects I was excited about before Boston have not been compatible with warm weather, ironman training, and a busier-than-usual summer at work. But shorter days are signaling the demise of summer, and I find myself in a 5-week limbo between Ironman Muskoka and the Chicago marathon - a good time to retool and attend to everything that has taken a backseat to training over the past four months.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s incredible what a week off from running can do. On the one hand I feel like I have so much energy I want to run 50 miles at marathon pace, while on the other my body seems to have forgotten all movement patterns associated with running. I used to experience this with swimming all the time - a couple of missed practices due to illness and my feel for the water vanished, at least for a day or two.</description>

Without any coordination, big A and I started our runs at the same time down to the minute, and went the same distance down to a tenth of a mile. Clearly we possess some sort of supernatural marital running synchronicity.</description>

      <description>I felt a sense of relief on many fronts this week. Last week was my peak long run distance (24 miles), my highest volume of running ever, and my first time over 100 miles. It also marked the first break in winter, with some positively gorgeous weather on Sunday. I had two easy runs on the schedule, and sometimes that second one can be something of a drag when I really just feel like putting my feet up after a long run and a long training week.</description>

      <description>The first races in the local running series took place last weekend - the aptly named Re-Fridgee-Eighter 8 mile and 8 km races. These are fun, non-standard distances and I signed up for the 8 miler. This was the first race shorter than a half-marathon I&amp;rsquo;ve done in a while. To be honest I&amp;rsquo;m a little frightened of shorter races - I find the prospect of really hard running more daunting than the challenge of longer distances.</description>

      <description>&#34;Activity and rest are two vital aspects of life. To find a balance in them is a skill in itself. Wisdom is knowing when to have rest, when to have activity, and how much of each to have. Finding them in each other - activity in rest and rest in activity - is the ultimate freedom.” Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Celebrating Silence: Excerpts from Five Years of Weekly Knowledge 1995-2000  I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with a little foot injury right now, and after a huge block of consistent training I struggled at first with having to take some time off.</description>
