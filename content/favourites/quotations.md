### The Eden Express, Mark Vonnegut

> Among amateurs, most "touch-move" games are lost on stupid blunders. The game becomes pointless very early: neither player learns anything. I'm capable of playing a good game of touch-move, but I have a hard time enjoying it. I beat players I should lose to and lose to players I should beat. Either way, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
> Touch-move fans argue with equal fervor that being able to take moves back ruins the game. It's bad preparation for tournament play, encourages sloppiness. Maybe they're right. Maybe we should be made to face the consequences of our blunders. Cold hard world and all.
> Life is a lot more like touch-move than friendly chess, but maybe that's because there are so many goddamned touch-move players around.
> What I hope is true is that if we go about it the right way, we can take back a lot more than we think we can. If we could all make an effort to let anyone take back anything, if it's in our power to let them take back instead of jumping so greedily at mistakes, we might be able to make life much more pleasant. We might even be able to find a way to go backward in time and patch up what now look like irrevocable blunders. Letting friends take back chess moves would be as good a way to start as any.
